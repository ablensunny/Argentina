    <h2 class="li">Argentina national football team</h2>
    <p>The Argentina national football team represents Argentina in men's international football and is administered by the Argentine Football Association, the governing body for football in Argentina.
        Nicknamed La Albiceleste ('The White and Sky Blue'), they are the reigning world champions, having won the most recent World Cup in 2022. Overall, Argentina has appeared in a World Cup final six times; a record surpassed only by Brazil and Germany; Argentina played in the first ever final in 1930, which they lost 4–2 to their South American rival Uruguay. Argentina's next final appearance came 48 years later, in 1978, when the team captained by Daniel Passarella defeated the Netherlands 3–1 in extra time, being crowned world champions for the first time. Captained by Diego Maradona, Argentina won their second World Cup eight years later, in 1986, with a 3–2 final victory over West Germany. They reached the final once more under the guidance of Maradona, in 1990, but were ultimately beaten 1–0 by West Germany.

    <p>A few decades later, the team led by Lionel Messi, Argentina made their fifth final appearance in 2014, losing to Germany 1–0 after extra time. In 2022, again captained by Messi, they were crowned the World Champions for the third time, the fourth-most of any country, beating France 4–2 on penalties, following a 3–3 draw after extra time. The team's World Cup–winning managers are César Luis Menotti in 1978, Carlos Bilardo in 1986 and Lionel Scaloni in 2022. Since the Golden Ball for tournament's best player has been officially awarded by FIFA from 1982, Argentina players have won it thrice; Maradona in 1986 and Messi in 2014 and 2022. Argentines Guillermo Stábile and Mario Kempes both won the Golden Boot as the tournament's top scorer, in 1930 and 1978, respectively.

    <h2 class="li">History</h2>
    <p>The first match ever recorded for Argentina was against Uruguay, on 20 June 1902.[note 2] The game (which was the first international for both sides) was held in Montevideo and Argentina won 6–0.[3][6] During the first years of its existence, the Argentina national team only played friendly matches against other South American teams. The reasons for this varied, including long travel times between countries and the interruption of World War I.[16]

        La Selección (national team), also known as the Albicelestes (sky blue and whites), has appeared in six World Cup finals, including the first final in 1930, which they lost, 4–2, to Uruguay. Argentina won in their next final in 1978, beating the Netherlands, 3–1. Argentina, led by Diego Maradona won again in 1986, a 3–2 victory over West Germany. Argentina last reached the World Cup final in 2014, where it lost 1–0 to Germany. Previous to this their last World Cup final was in 1990, which is also lost, 1–0, to West Germany by a much-disputed penalty. In 2022, Argentina won the World Cup for the third time, beating France 4–2 on penalties following a 3–3 draw after extra time. The team's World Cup-winning managers are César Luis Menotti in 1978, Carlos Bilardo in 1986, and Lionel Scaloni in 2022.
        
        Argentina has been very successful in the Copa América, winning it 15 times. The team also won the FIFA Confederations Cup and the Kirin Cup, both in 1992, the CONMEBOL–UEFA Cup of Champions in 1993 and 2022, and the Nations' Cup in 1964. Argentina 'Olympic' team (with only three players of over 23 years of age included in the squad) won the Olympics football tournaments in Athens 2004 and Beijing 2008.[17]
        
        Argentina also won seven of the 18 football competitions at the Pan American Games, winning in 1951, 1955, 1959, 1971, 1995, 2003 and 2019.
        
        In March 2007, Argentina reached the top of the FIFA World Rankings for the first time.

    <h2 class="li">Home Stadium</h2>
    <p>Argentina play most of their home matches at River Plate stadium, Estadio Monumental in Buenos Aires,[19][20] although the team has also played in other venues such as Rosario Central,[21] (during the 2010 World Cup qualification)[22][23] Estadio Único Madre de Ciudades in Santiago del Estero,[24][25] Boca Juniors' stadium (La Bombonera)[25] Those venues were used in some matches of the 2022 World Cup qualification,[26] along with Estadio Mario Alberto Kempes in Córdoba and Estadio San Juan del Bicentenario in the homonymous province.[27]

        GEBA Stadium was the venue where Argentina played their first international matches as local team. The match held on 13 September 1908, for the Copa Newton v. Uruguay has a historic relevance for being the first time Argentine wore the light blue and white striped jersey, which would be the definitive uniform up to present days.[28] GEBA was also venue for the Copa Centenario Revolución de Mayo, the first international South American competition organised in 1910. The Argentina national team played its last game at GEBA on 19 October 1919, when the squad won the Copa Premier Honor Argentino after thrashing Uruguay by 6–1,[29]
        
        Other memorable venue for Argentina was Estadio Sportivo Barracas, which holds an important anecdotal fact in its history on 2 October 1924, when Argentina beat Uruguay 2–1 with a goal converted directly from a corner kick by forward Cesáreo Onzari. Since then, a goal like Onzari's is referred as a Gol olímpico or Olympic goal.[30] Sportivo Barracas was the usual venue for Argentina from 1920 to 1932. The stadium would be later demolished in 1937.
